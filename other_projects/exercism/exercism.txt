I have spent the whole of today working through the Ruby exercism track. 

This can be viewed in my exercism account however I would like to evidence todays work with a commit.

This is the commit. 

INFACT! Going forward, upon completion of an online resource that utlilses its own repo/workspace 
I'll be adding a .txt file so my efforts translate to a commit. 

All about those green squares baby!!!!
