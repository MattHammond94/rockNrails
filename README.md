# Ruby On Rails

### Overview

> This repo is used for all learning materials I will be following for learning the fundamentals of Ruby on Rails.

### Rails for Ruby

* Rails is a framework for Ruby based backend

```gem install rails```

> Rails 7 provides import maps allowing use of JS modules directly from browser. 

* Although this is the case it is best to use Yarn as some files may need to be compiled or bundled.

* Yarn is another package manager - like npm or bundler.

> Installed yarn globally in past. run: ```yarn -v``` to check version.


* Creating a rails app from chosen directory: ```rails new rails_app```

* running a rails app: ```rails server```

> After generating any scaffolds run rails db:migrate to update database schemas.
